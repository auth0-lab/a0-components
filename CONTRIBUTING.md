## Code of Conduct

By participating and contributing to this project, you are expected to uphold our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/auth0/open-source-template/blob/master/CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md).

## Getting Started

### Making Changes

When contributing to a repository, the first step is to open an issue in that repository to discuss the change you wish to make before making them.

### Opening Issues

Before you submit a new issue please make sure to search all open and closed issues. It is possible your feature request/issue has already been answered.

This repo includes an issue template that will walk through all the places to check before submitting your issue here. Please follow the instructions there to make sure this is not a duplicate issue and we have everything we need to research and reproduce this problem.

### Submitting Pull Requests

Same goes for PRs, please search all open and closed PRs before submitting a new one. We do not want duplicate effort.

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

- Fork the repository to your own Github account
- Clone the project to your machine
- Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name
- Commit changes to the branch
- Push changes to your fork
- Open a Pull Request in the repository (not your own fork) and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request.

## Getting in touch

### Have a question or problem?

Please do not open issues for general support or usage questions. Instead, join us over in the Auth0Lab community at [discord.gg/XbQpZSF2Ys](https://discord.gg/XbQpZSF2Ys) and post your question there in the correct channel.

### Vulnerability Reporting

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on the public GitHub issue tracker. The [Responsible Disclosure Program](https://auth0.com/whitehat) details the procedure for disclosing security issues.
