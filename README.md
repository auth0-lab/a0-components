# Auth0 Lab / UI Components

The UI components are an experimental Auth0Lab library. They might not remain available or be incorporated into the Auth0 platform. Use of these components is without support and all questions should be directed to the open source repository or the [Auth0Lab discord](https://discord.gg/QGHxwDsbQQ).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
