# Auth0 Lab / UI Components

The UI Components are for experimentation and testing purposes only, not intended for production use. They are provided for evaluation in a non-commercial environment and may not remain available or be incorporated into the Auth0 platform. Use of these components is without support, and all questions should be directed to discussion groups.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
